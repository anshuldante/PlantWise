# Bugs and Improvements

1. The name and hint for nickname and location fields come on top of each other, attach screenshot.
2. The details on the details screen come behind the back, home and menu buttons, making it hard to take another pic of the plant, attach screenshot.
3. There is no way to browse any analysis history, is that expected.
4. No care history is available for browsing on the details page.
5. The photo tips should come before a photo is messed up, maybe we can change the plant add flow a bit and initiate it as an add plant button, where one can add data, instead of going to the camera button directly.
6. The photo quality check seems to be too tight, the app shows every photo as blurry or low quality or low light.
7. Rename library to My Garden and use 🌱 icon.
8. The thumbnail on the details page is of pretty bad quality, use the original picture instead.
